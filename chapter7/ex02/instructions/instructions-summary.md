## Your Tasks

In this lab, you will use what you have learned about accumulating totals in a single-level control break program to complete a Python program. The program should produce a report for a supermarket manager to help her keep track of the hours worked by her part-time employees. The report should include the day of the week, the number of hours worked by each employee for each day, and the total hours worked by all employees each day.

The program provided for this lab includes the necessary variable initializations and input and output statements. You need to implement the code that recognizes when a control break should occur. You also need to complete the control break code. Be sure to accumulate the daily totals for all days in the week. Comments in the code tell you where to write your code. You can use the _ClientByState.py_ program in this chapter as a guide for this new program.
