## Your Tasks

In this lab, you complete a partially pre-written Python program that uses a list. The program prompts the user to interactively enter eight batting averages, which the program stores in a list. It should then find the minimum and maximum batting averages stored in the list, as well as the average of the eight batting averages. The data file provided for this lab includes the input statement and some variable initializations. Comments are included in the file to help you write the remainder of the program.
