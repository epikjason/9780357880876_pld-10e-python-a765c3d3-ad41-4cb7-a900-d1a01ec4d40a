## Your Tasks

In this lab, you will complete a Python program that swaps values stored in three `int` variables and determines maximum and minimum values. The Python file provided for this lab contains the necessary variable initializations, as well as the input and output statements. You want to end up with the smallest value stored in the variable named `first` and the largest value stored in the variable named `third`. You need to write statements that compare the values and swap them, if appropriate. Comments included in the code tell you where to write your statements
