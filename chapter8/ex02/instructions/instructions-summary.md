## Your Tasks

In this lab, you will complete a Python program that uses a list to store data for the village of Marengo. The program is described in _Chapter 8, Exercise 5_. The program should allow the user to enter each household size and determine the mean and median household size in Marengo. The program should output the mean and median household size in Marengo. The file provided for this lab contains the necessary variable initializations and input statements. You need to write the code that sorts the household sizes in ascending order using a bubble sort and then prints the mean and median household size in Marengo. Comments in the code tell you where to write your statements.
