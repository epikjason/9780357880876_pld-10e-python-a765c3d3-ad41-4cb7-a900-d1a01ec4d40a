## Your Tasks

In this lab, you add nested loops to a Python program provided with the data files for this book. The program should print the letter _E_, as shown below. The letter E is printed using asterisks, three across and five down. Note that this program uses `print("\*", end="")` to print an asterisk without a new line.
