## Your Tasks

In this lab, you add a loop and the statements that make up the loop body to a Python program provided. When completed, the program should calculate two totals: the number of left-handed people and the number of right-handed people in your class. Your loop should execute until the user enters the character **X** instead of an **L** for left-handed or an **R** for right-handed.
