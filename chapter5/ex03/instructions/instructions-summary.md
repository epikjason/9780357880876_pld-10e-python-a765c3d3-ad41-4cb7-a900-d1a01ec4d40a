## Your Tasks

In this lab, you work with the same Python program you worked with in *Lab 5-1*. As in *Lab 5-1*, the completed program should print the numbers 0 through 10, along with their values multiplied by 2 and by 10. However, in this lab, you should accomplish this using a `for` loop instead of a counter-controlled while loop.
