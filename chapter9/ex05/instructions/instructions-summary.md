## Your Tasks

In this lab, you complete a partially written Python program that reverses the order of five numbers stored in a list. The program should first print the five numbers stored in the list. Next, the program passes the list to a function where the numbers are reversed. Finally, the main program should print the reversed numbers.
The source code file provided for this lab includes the necessary variable initializations. Comments are included in the file to help you write the remainder of the program
