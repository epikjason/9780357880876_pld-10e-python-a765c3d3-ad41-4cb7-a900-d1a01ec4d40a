## Your Tasks

In this lab, you complete a partially written Python program that includes a function that returns a value. The program is a simple calculator that prompts the user for two numbers and an operator (+, â€“, \*, /, or %). The two numbers and the operator are passed to the function where the appropriate arithmetic operation is
performed. The result is then returned to the `main()` function where the arithmetic operation and result are displayed. For example, if the user enters **3**, **4**, and **\***, the following is displayed:

```
3.00
 *
4.00
 =
12.00
```

The source code file provided for this lab includes the necessary variable initializations and input and output statements. Comments are included in the file to help you write the remainder of the program
