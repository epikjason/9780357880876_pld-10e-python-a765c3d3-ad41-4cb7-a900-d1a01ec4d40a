## Your Tasks

In this lab, you complete a partially pre-written Python program that includes a function with no parameters.

The program asks the user if they have preregistered for art show tickets. If the user has preregistered, the program should call a function named `discount()` that displays the message **"You are pre-registered and qualify for a 5% discount."** If the user has not preregistered, the program should call a function named `noDiscount()` that displays the message **"Sorry, you did not pre-register and do not qualify for a 5% discount."**

The source code file provided for this lab includes the necessary `input` statement. Comments are included in the file to help you write the remainder of the program.
