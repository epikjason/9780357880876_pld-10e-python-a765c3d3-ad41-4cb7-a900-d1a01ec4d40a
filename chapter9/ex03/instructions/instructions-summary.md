## Your Tasks

In this lab, you complete a partially written Python program that includes functions that require multiple parameters (arguments). The program prompts the user for two numeric values. Both values should be passed to functions named `calculateSum()`, `calculateDifference()`, and `calculateProduct()`. The functions compute the sum of the two values, the difference between the two values, and the product of the two values. Each function should perform the appropriate computation and display the results. The source code file provided for this lab includes the variable initializations and the input statements. Comments are included in the file to help you write the remainder of the program.
