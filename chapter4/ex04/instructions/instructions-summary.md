## Your Tasks

In this lab, you complete a pre-written Python program that calculates an employee’s end-of-year bonus and prints the employee’s name, yearly salary, performance rating, and bonus. In this program, bonuses are calculated based on employees’ annual salary and their performance rating. The rating system is contained in **Table 4-5**.

| Rating | Bonus                       |
| ------ | --------------------------- |
| 1      | 25 percent of annual salary |
| 2      | 15 percent of annual salary |
| 3      | 10 percent of annual salary |
| 4      | None                        |
