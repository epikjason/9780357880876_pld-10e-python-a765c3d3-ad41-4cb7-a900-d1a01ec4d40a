## Your Tasks

In this lab, you complete a pre-written Python program that calculates an employee’s productivity bonus and prints the employee’s name and bonus. Bonuses are calculated based on an employee’s productivity score as shown below. A productivity score is calculated by first dividing an employee’s transactions dollar value by the number of transactions and then dividing the result by the number of shifts worked.

| Productivity Score | Bonus |
| -----------------: | :---- |
|               <=30 | $50   |
|              31–69 | $75   |
|             70–199 | $100  |
|             >= 200 | $200  |
