## Your Tasks

In this lab, you complete a pre-written Python program that computes the largest and smallest of three integer values. The three values are -50, 53, 78.

## Instructions

Two variables named `largest` and `smallest` are declared for you. Use these variables to store the largest and smallest of the three integer values. Three variables have been declared for you `firstNumber`, `secondNumber`, `thirdNumber`. You must decide what other variables you will need and initialize them as appropriate.
